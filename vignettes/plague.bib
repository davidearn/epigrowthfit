                   have drastically expanded the scope of genetic
                   analyses of ancient specimens to the extent that full
                   genomic investigations are now feasible and are
                   quickly becoming standard(1). This trend has
                   important implications for infectious disease
                   research because genomic data from ancient microbes
                   may help to elucidate mechanisms of pathogen
                   evolution and adaptation for emerging and re-emerging
                   infections. Here we report a reconstructed ancient
                   genome of Yersinia pestis at 30-fold average coverage
                   from Black Death victims securely dated to episodes
                   of pestilence-associated mortality in London,
                   England, 1348-1350. Genetic architecture and
                   phylogenetic analysis indicate that the ancient
                   organismis ancestral to most extant strains and sits
                   very close to the ancestral node of all Y. pestis
                   commonly associated with human infection. Temporal
                   estimates suggest that the Black Death of 1347-1351
                   was the main historical event responsible for the
                   introduction and widespread dissemination of the
                   ancestor to all currently circulating Y. pestis
                   strains pathogenic to humans, and further indicates
                   that contemporary Y. pestis epidemics have their
                   origins in the medieval era. Comparisons against
                   modern genomes reveal no unique derived positions in
                   the medieval organism, indicating that the perceived
                   increased virulence of the disease during the Black
                   Death may not have been due to bacterial phenotype.
                   These findings support the notion that factors other
                   than microbial genetics, such as environment, vector
                   dynamics and host susceptibility, should be at the
                   forefront of epidemiological discussions regarding
                   emerging Y. pestis infections.},

  abstract =      {BACKGROUND: Yersinia pestis has caused at least three
                   human plague pandemics. The second (Black Death,
                   14--17th centuries) and third (19--20th centuries)
                   have been genetically characterised, but there is
                   only a limited understanding of the first pandemic,
                   the Plague of Justinian (6-8th centuries). To address
                   this gap, we sequenced and analysed draft genomes of
                   Y pestis obtained from two individuals who died in
                   the first pandemic. METHODS: Teeth were removed from
                   two individuals (known as A120 and A76) from the
                   early medieval Aschheim-Bajuwarenring cemetery
                   (Aschheim, Bavaria, Germany). We isolated DNA from
                   the teeth using a modified phenol-chloroform method.
                   We screened DNA extracts for the presence of the Y
                   pestis-specific pla gene on the pPCP1 plasmid using
                   primers and standards from an established assay,
                   enriched the DNA, and then sequenced it. We
                   reconstructed draft genomes of the infectious Y
                   pestis strains, compared them with a database of
                   genomes from 131 Y pestis strains from the second and
                   third pandemics, and constructed a maximum likelihood
                   phylogenetic tree. FINDINGS: Radiocarbon dating of
                   both individuals (A120 to 533 AD [plus or minus 98
                   years]; A76 to 504 AD [plus or minus 61 years])
                   places them in the timeframe of the first pandemic.
                   Our phylogeny contains a novel branch (100\%
                   bootstrap at all relevant nodes) leading to the two
                   Justinian samples. This branch has no known
                   contemporary representatives, and thus is either
                   extinct or unsampled in wild rodent reservoirs. The
                   Justinian branch is interleaved between two extant
                   groups, 0.ANT1 and 0.ANT2, and is distant from
                   strains associated with the second and third
                   pandemics. INTERPRETATION: We conclude that the Y
                   pestis lineages that caused the Plague of Justinian
                   and the Black Death 800 years later were independent
                   emergences from rodents into human beings. These
                   results show that rodent species worldwide represent
                   important reservoirs for the repeated emergence of
                   diverse lineages of Y pestis into human populations.

                   an important measure of disease spread, and is
                   commonly used to infer the basic reproduction number
                   [Formula: see text]. While modern techniques (e.g.,
                   MCMC and particle filtering) for parameter estimation
                   of mechanistic models have gained popularity, maximum
                   likelihood fitting of phenomenological models remains
                   important due to its simplicity, to the difficulty of
                   using modern methods in the context of limited data,
                   and to the fact that there is not always enough
                   information available to choose an appropriate
                   mechanistic model. However, it is often not clear
                   which phenomenological model is appropriate for a
                   given dataset. We compare the performance of four
                   commonly used phenomenological models (exponential,
                   Richards, logistic, and delayed logistic) in
                   estimating initial epidemic growth rates by maximum
                   likelihood, by fitting them to simulated epidemics
                   with known parameters. For incidence data, both the
                   logistic model and the Richards model yield accurate
                   point estimates for fitting windows up to the
                   epidemic peak. When observation errors are small, the
                   Richards model yields confidence intervals with
                   better coverage. For mortality data, the Richards
                   model and the delayed logistic model yield the best
                   growth rate estimates. We also investigate the width
                   and coverage of the confidence intervals
                   corresponding to these fits.},

                   control of emerging infectious diseases. A key
                   variable in such models is the reproductive number R.
                   For new emerging infectious diseases, the value of
                   the reproductive number can only be inferred
                   indirectly from the observed exponential epidemic
                   growth rate r. Such inference is ambiguous as several
                   different equations exist that relate the
                   reproductive number to the growth rate, and it is
                   unclear which of these equations might apply to a new
                   infection. Here, we show that these different
                   equations differ only with respect to their assumed
                   shape of the generation interval distribution.
                   Therefore, the shape of the generation interval
                   distribution determines which equation is appropriate
                   for inferring the reproductive number from the
                   observed growth rate. We show that by assuming all
                   generation intervals to be equal to the mean, we
                   obtain an upper bound to the range of possible values
                   that the reproductive number may attain for a given
                   growth rate. Furthermore, we show that by taking the
                   generation interval distribution equal to the
                   observed distribution, it is possible to obtain an
                   empirical estimate of the reproductive number.},

                   past outbreaks that shows that the average number of
                   secondary cases per primary case (R-0) was 1.3
                   (variance = 3.1), assuming a geometric probability
                   distribution, prior to outbreak control measures. We
                   also show that the latent and infectious periods can
                   be approximated by using lognormal distributions with
                   means (SD) of 4.3 (1.8) and 2.5 (1.2) days. Based on
                   this parameter estimation, we construct a
                   Markov-chain epidemic model to demonstrate the
                   potential impact of delays in implementing outbreak
                   control measures and increasing numbers of index
                   cases on the incidence of cases in simulated
                   outbreaks.},

  abstract =      {The well-known formula for the final size of an
                   epidemic was published by Kermack and McKendrick in
                   1927. Their analysis was based on a simple
                   susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model that
                   assumes exponentially distributed infectious periods.
                   More recent analyses have established that the
                   standard final size formula is valid regardless of
                   the distribution of infectious periods, but that it
                   fails to be correct in the presence of certain kinds
                   of heterogeneous mixing (e.g., if there is a core
                   group, as for sexually transmitted diseases). We
                   review previous work and establish more general
                   conditions under which Kermack and McKendrick's
                   formula is valid. We show that the final size formula
                   is unchanged if there is a latent stage, any number
                   of distinct infectious stages and/or a stage during
                   which infectives are isolated (the durations of each
                   stage can be drawn from any integrable distribution).
                   We also consider the possibility that the
                   transmission rates of infectious Individuals are
                   arbitrarily distributed-allowing, in particular, for
                   the existence of super-spreaders-and prove that this
                   potential complexity has no impact on the final Size
                   formula. Finally. we show that the final size formula
                   is unchanged even for a General class of spatial
                   contact structures. We conclude that whenever a new
                   respiratory pathogen emerges, an estimate of the
                   expected magnitude of the epidemic can be made as
                   soon the basic reproduction number R-0 can be
                   approximated, and this estimate is likely to be
                   improved only by more accurate estimates of R-0 not
                   by knowledge of any other epidemiological details.},

                   used to predict the spread of infectious diseases in
                   populations. Successful analysis and modeling of
                   historical infectious disease data can explain
                   changes in the pattern of past epidemics and lead to
                   a better understanding of epidemiological processes.
                   The lessons learned can be used to predict future
                   epidemics and help to improve public healthstrategies
                   for control and eradication. This thesis is focused
                   on the analysis and modelling of smallpox dynamics
                   based on the weekly smallpox mortality records in
                   London, England, 1664--1930. Statistical analysis of
                   these records is presented. A timeline of significant
                   historical events related to changes in variolation
                   and vaccination uptake levels and demographics was
                   established. These events were correlated with
                   transitions observed in smallpox dynamics.
                   Seasonality of the smallpox time series was
                   investigated and the contact rate between susceptible
                   and infectious individuals was found to be seasonally
                   forced. Seasonal variations in smallpox transmission
                   and changes in their seasonality over long time scale
                   were estimated. The method of transition analysis,
                   which is used to predict qualitative changes in
                   epidemiological patterns, was used to explain the
                   transitions observed in the smallpox time series. We
                   found that the standard SIR model exhibits dynamics
                   similar to the more realistic Gamma distributed SEIR
                   model if the mean serial interval is chosen the same,
                   so we used the standard SIR model for our analysis.
                   We conclude that transitions observed in the temporal
                   pattern of smallpox dynamics can be explained by the
                   changes in birth, immigration and intervention uptake
                   levels.},

                   have identified Yersinia pestis as the putative

                   limitations have prevented large-scale genomic
                   investigations to evaluate changes in the pathogen's
                   virulence over time. We screened over 100 skeletal
                   remains from Black Death victims of the East
                   Smithfield mass burial site (1348-1350, London,

                   with high-throughput DNA sequencing subsequently
                   permitted reconstruction of ten full human
                   mitochondrial genomes (16 kb each) and the full pPCP1
                   (9.6 kb) virulence-associated plasmid at high
                   coverage. Comparisons of molecular damage profiles

                   representing the longest contiguous genomic sequence

                   reconstructed plasmid against modern Y. pestis shows
                   identity with several isolates matching the
                   Medievalis biovar; however, our chromosomal sequences
                   indicate the victims were infected with a Y. pestis
                   variant that has not been previously reported. Our
                   data reveal that the Black Death in medieval Europe
                   was caused by a variant of Y. pestis that may no
                   longer exist, and genetic data carried on its pPCP1
                   plasmid were not responsible for the purported
                   epidemiological differences between ancient and

  abstract =      {Multiple transmission pathways exist for many
                   waterborne diseases, including cholera, Giardia,
                   Cryptosporidium, and Campylobacter. Theoretical work
                   exploring the effects of multiple transmission
                   pathways on disease dynamics is incomplete. Here, we
                   consider a simple ODE model that extends the
                   classical SIR framework by adding a compartment (W )
                   that tracks pathogen concentration in the water.
                   Infected individuals shed pathogen into the water
                   compartment, and new infections arise both through
                   exposure to contaminated water, as well as by the
                   classical SIR person--person transmission pathway. We
                   compute the basic reproductive number (R0), epidemic
                   growth rate, and final outbreak size for the
                   resulting "SIWR" model, and examine how these
                   fundamental quantities depend upon the transmission
                   parameters for the different pathways. We prove that
                   the endemic disease equilibrium for the SIWR model is
                   globally stable. We identify the pathogen decay rate
                   in the water compartment as a key parameter
                   determining when the distinction between the
                   different transmission routes in the SIWR model is
                   important. When the decay rate is slow, using an SIR
                   model rather than the SIWR model can lead to
                   under-estimates of the basic reproductive number and
                   over-estimates of the infectious period.},

                   seasonal, with peak mortality almost always in the
                   summer, (ii) the only non--summer outbreaks occurred
                   in the spring of 1832, the autumn of 1848 and the
                   winter of 1853, and (iii) extraordinarily severe
                   summer outbreaks occurred in 1832, 1849, 1854 and
                   1866 (the four 'great' cholera years). The
                   non--summer outbreaks of 1832, 1848 and 1853 appear
                   to have been herald waves of newly invading cholera
                   strains. In addition, a simple mathematical model
                   confirms that a non--summer introduction of a new
                   cholera strain can result in an initial herald wave,
                   followed by a severe outbreak the following summer.
                   Through the analysis of the genomes of
                   nineteenth--century specimens, it may be possible to
                   identify the strains that caused these herald waves
                   and the well--known cholera epidemics that followed.},

The types of network models are exponential random graph models (ERGMs) and extensions of the configuration model. We use three kinds of empirical contact networks, chosen to provide both variety and realistic patterns of human contact: a highly clustered network, a bipartite network and a snowball sampled network of a “hidden population”. In the case of the snowball sampled network we present a novel method for fitting an edge-triangle model. In our results, ERGMs consistently capture clustering as well or better than configuration-type models, but the latter models better capture the node degree distribution. Despite the additional computational requirements to fit ERGMs to empirical networks, the use of ERGMs provides only a slight improvement in the ability of the models to recreate epidemic features of the empirical network in simulated SIR epidemics. Generally, SIR epidemic results from using configuration-type models fall between those from a random network model (i.e., an Erdős-Rényi model) and an ERGM. The addition of subgraphs of size four to edge-triangle type models does improve agreement with the empirical network for smaller densities in clustered networks. Additional subgraphs do not make a noticeable difference in our example, although we would expect the ability to model cliques to be helpful for contact networks exhibiting household structure.},

  abstract={The Black Death (1347-1353 AD) initiated the second plague pandemic in Europe (14th-18th centuries AD), and its etiological agent has for long been a topic of academic debate. In recent years, next generation sequencing (NGS) technology enabled the reconstruction of Yersinia pestis genomes from Black Death victims in London, as well as from post-Black Death outbreaks in Ellwangen, Germany (1485-1627 cal AD) and Marseille, France (Plague of Marseille, 1720-1722 AD). Though plague is absent in Europe today, the sequencing of these historical genomes allowed the identification of a previously uncharacterized plague lineage that persisted in Europe during the second plague pandemic and seems to now be extinct. Here we present the reconstruction of five additional Y. pestis genomes from a 17th century outbreak in London from this putatively extinct European lineage. We identify extensive genome decay along this terminal branch, most notably within regions associated with flagellum expression and chemotaxis. In addition, due to exceptional preservation of long Y. pestis fragments in one of the samples, we attempt a de novo assembly of its genome. Through these analyses we hope to better understand the ongoing processes of genome rearrangements and decay, which might have influenced the biology of Y. pestis during its 400 years of persistence in Europe.}

	abstract = {Plague, caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, can spread through human populations by multiple transmission pathways. Today, most human plague cases are bubonic, caused by spillover of infected fleas from rodent epizootics, or pneumonic, caused by inhalation of infectious droplets. However, little is known about the historical spread of plague in Europe during the Second Pandemic (14–19th centuries), including the Black Death, which led to high mortality and recurrent epidemics for hundreds of years. Several studies have suggested that human ectoparasite vectors, such as human fleas (Pulex irritans) or body lice (Pediculus humanus humanus), caused the rapidly spreading epidemics. Here, we describe a compartmental model for plague transmission by a human ectoparasite vector. Using Bayesian inference, we found that this model fits mortality curves from nine outbreaks in Europe better than models for pneumonic or rodent transmission. Our results support that human ectoparasites were primary vectors for plague during the Second Pandemic, including the Black Death (1346–1353), ultimately challenging the assumption that plague in Europe was predominantly spread by rats.},

	abstract = {As an emergent infectious disease outbreak unfolds, public health response is reliant on information on key epidemiological quantities, such as transmission potential and serial interval. Increasingly, transmission models fit to incidence data are used to estimate these parameters and guide policy. Some widely used modelling practices lead to potentially large errors in parameter estimates and, consequently, errors in model-based forecasts. Even more worryingly, in such situations, confidence in parameter estimates and forecasts can itself be far overestimated, leading to the potential for large errors that mask their own presence. Fortunately, straightforward and computationally inexpensive alternatives exist that avoid these problems. Here, we first use a simulation study to demonstrate potential pitfalls of the standard practice of fitting deterministic models to cumulative incidence data. Next, we demonstrate an alternative based on stochastic models fit to raw data from an early phase of 2014 West Africa Ebola virus disease outbreak. We show not only that bias is thereby reduced, but that uncertainty in estimates and forecasts is better quantified and that, critically, lack of model fit is more readily diagnosed. We conclude with a short list of principles to guide the modelling response to future infectious disease outbreaks.},

The investigation of causal factors, which command the disease dynamics in rodent populations, is a crucial step to forecast, control and anticipate the infection extension to humans. This paper presents simulation results obtained from an epidemic model, SIMPEST, designed to simulate bubonic plague in a rodent population at a high level of spatial and temporal resolution. We developed a structurally realistic individual-based model, mobilizing knowledge about fleas and rats behaviour, inter-individual plague transmission, and disease evolution in individual organisms, so that the model reflects the way the real system operates and to generate spatial and temporal patterns of disease spread. To assess the structural validity of our simulations, we perform sensitivity analyses on the initial population size and spatial distribution, and compare our results with theoretical statements, garnered from both previous modelling experiences and repeated field observations. We show our results are consistent with referents about population size conditions for a disease to invade and persist and the effect of the contact network on disease dynamics.},

	abstract = {Background Transmission of Yersinia pestis by flea bite can occur by two mechanisms. After taking a blood meal from a bacteremic mammal, fleas have the potential to transmit the very next time they feed. This early-phase transmission resembles mechanical transmission in some respects, but the mechanism is unknown. Thereafter, transmission occurs after Yersinia pestis forms a biofilm in the proventricular valve in the flea foregut. The biofilm can impede and sometimes completely block the ingestion of blood, resulting in regurgitative transmission of bacteria into the bite site. In this study, we compared the relative efficiency of the two modes of transmission for Xenopsylla cheopis, a flea known to become completely blocked at a high rate, and Oropsylla montana, a flea that has been considered to rarely develop proventricular blockage. Methodology/Principal findings Fleas that took an infectious blood meal containing Y. pestis were maintained and monitored for four weeks for infection and proventricular blockage. The number of Y. pestis transmitted by groups of fleas by the two modes of transmission was also determined. O. montana readily developed complete proventricular blockage, and large numbers of Y. pestis were transmitted by that mechanism both by it and by X. cheopis, a flea known to block at a high rate. In contrast, few bacteria were transmitted in the early phase by either species. Conclusions A model system incorporating standardized experimental conditions and viability controls was developed to more reliably compare the infection, proventricular blockage and transmission dynamics of different flea vectors, and was used to resolve a long-standing uncertainty concerning the vector competence of O. montana. Both X. cheopis and O. montana are fully capable of transmitting Y. pestis by the proventricular biofilm-dependent mechanism.},

	abstract = {We lack a clear understanding of the enzootic maintenance of the bacterium (Yersinia pestis) that causes plague and the sporadic epizootics that occur in its natural rodent hosts. A key to elucidating these epidemiological dynamics is determining the dominant transmission routes of plague. Plague can be acquired from the bites of infectious fleas (which is generally considered to occur via a blocked flea vector), inhalation of infectious respiratory droplets, or contact with a short-term infectious reservoir. We present results from a plague modeling approach that includes transmission from all three sources of infection simultaneously and uses sensitivity analysis to determine their relative importance. Our model is completely parameterized by using data from the literature and our own field studies of plague in the black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus). Results of the model are qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with independent data from our field sites. Although infectious fleas might be an important source of infection and transmission via blocked fleas is a dominant paradigm in the literature, our model clearly predicts that this form of transmission cannot drive epizootics in prairie dogs. Rather, a short-term reservoir is required for epizootic dynamics. Several short-term reservoirs have the potential to affect the prairie dog system. Our model predictions of the residence time of the short-term reservoir suggest that other small mammals, infectious prairie dog carcasses, fleas that transmit plague without blockage of the digestive tract, or some combination of these three are the most likely of the candidate infectious reservoirs.},

In order to prepare for such an event, it is important, particularly for medical personnel and first responders, to form a realistic idea of the risk of person-to-person spread of infection. Historical accounts and contemporary experience show that pneumonic plague is not as contagious as it is commonly believed to be. Persons with plague usually only transmit the infection when the disease is in the endstage, when infected persons cough copious amounts of bloody sputum, and only by means of close contact. Before antibiotics were available for postexposure prophylaxis for contacts, simple protective measures, such as wearing masks and avoiding close contact, were sufficient to interrupt transmission during pneumonic plague outbreaks. In this article, I review the historical literature and anecdotal evidence regarding the risk of transmission, and I discuss possible protective measures.}",
