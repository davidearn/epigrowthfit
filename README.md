# epigrowthfit

`epigrowthfit` is an R package for estimating parameters associated with initial epidemic growth.  The methodology is based on:

[Ma J, Dushoff J, Bolker BM, Earn DJD (2014). “Estimating initial epidemic growth rates.” Bull. Math. Biol., 76(1), 245-260.](https://davidearn.mcmaster.ca/publications/MaEtAl2014)

We have chosen to make the current package available publicly now (March 2020) in order to help people analyzing COVID-19 data.  The documentation will improve over time.  If you have suggestions for improvement, please e-mail us (bbolker@gmail.com and earn@math.mcmaster.ca).
