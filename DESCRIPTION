Title:
	Nonlinear Mixed Effects Models of Epidemic Growth
Description:
	Maximum likelihood estimation of nonlinear mixed effects models of
	epidemic growth using Template Model Builder ('TMB').  Enables
	joint estimation for collections of disease incidence time series,
	including time series that describe multiple epidemic waves.
	Supports a set of widely used phenomenological models: exponential,
	logistic, Richards (generalized logistic), subexponential,
	and Gompertz.  Provides methods for interrogating model objects
	and several auxiliary functions, including one for computing basic
	reproduction numbers from fitted values of the initial exponential
	growth rate.
	Preliminary versions of this software were applied
	in Ma et al. (2014) <doi:10.1007/s11538-013-9918-2> and
	in Earn et al. (2020) <doi:10.1073/pnas.2004904117>.
