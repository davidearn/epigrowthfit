* TODO Submit epigrowthfit 0.15.0 to CRAN

** TODO Finish transition away from testthat

Easy stuff done with 'sed -e s/*/*/g'; rest "by hand".

** TODO De-activate "features" no longer wanted in API

Mostly straightforward, but documentation must be updated.

*** TODO plot(<egf_confint>, type = "boxes")
*** TODO confint(<egf>, top = c("R0", "tdoubling"))
*** TODO '.subset', '.append' arguments to methods [replace with 'nse' flag]

** TODO API change: user should specify cumulative incidence

So that future changes for non-count data are backwards compatible.

Will resolve awkwardness with interval incidence: first observation
is often discarded unnecessarily.

** TODO Prior distribution density function should integrate to one

So that later transition to TMB entry points is backwards compatible.

** TODO Update README.md

Should definitely happen, even if it is in .Rbuildignore.
