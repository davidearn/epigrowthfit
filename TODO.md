## Data
* Estimate plague mortality from wills and burials using
  baseline mortality in adjacent years
* Raw data isn't actually raw at the moment

## Documentation
* Data sources, especially for London Bills

## Code
* Make plot methods nicer
* Add random effects
* Add R back end
* Tests
* Why is `src/epigrowthfit.so` ~15 MB?

## Math
* GI stuff ... issues with GI density at the integers,
  differences with JD's code
* Reparametrization not consistent with Smirnova et al.
  it seems
