## Data
* Raw data isn't actually raw at the moment
* Data sources, especially for London Bills

## Code
* Implement delta method
* Add random effects
* Add R back end
* Write tests

## Math
* GI stuff ... issues with GI density at the integers,
  differences with JD's code
* Reparametrization not completely consistent with
  Smirnova et al., who eliminate K with a scaling
