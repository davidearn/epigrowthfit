## Data
* Estimate plague mortality from wills and burials using
  baseline mortality in adjacent years
* Raw data isn't actually raw at the moment

## Documentation
* Data sources, especially for London Bills
* Vignette details

## Code
* Implement delta method
* Add LaTeX option to plot methods
* Add random effects
* Add R back end
* Tests
* Why is `src/epigrowthfit.so` ~15 MB?

## Math
* GI stuff ... issues with GI density at the integers,
  differences with JD's code
* Reparametrization not completely consistent with
  Smirnova et al., who eliminate K with a scaling
