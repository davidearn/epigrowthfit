   Abstract = {The initial exponential growth rate of an epidemic is an important measure of disease spread, and is commonly used to infer the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text]. While modern techniques (e.g., MCMC and particle filtering) for parameter estimation of mechanistic models have gained popularity, maximum likelihood fitting of phenomenological models remains important due to its simplicity, to the difficulty of using modern methods in the context of limited data, and to the fact that there is not always enough information available to choose an appropriate mechanistic model. However, it is often not clear which phenomenological model is appropriate for a given dataset. We compare the performance of four commonly used phenomenological models (exponential, Richards, logistic, and delayed logistic) in estimating initial epidemic growth rates by maximum likelihood, by fitting them to simulated epidemics with known parameters. For incidence data, both the logistic model and the Richards model yield accurate point estimates for fitting windows up to the epidemic peak. When observation errors are small, the Richards model yields confidence intervals with better coverage. For mortality data, the Richards model and the delayed logistic model yield the best growth rate estimates. We also investigate the width and coverage of the confidence intervals corresponding to these fits.},

   Volume = {274},
   Pages = {599-604},
   Abstract = {Mathematical models of transmission have become invaluable management tools in planning for the control of emerging infectious diseases. A key variable in such models is the reproductive number R. For new emerging infectious diseases, the value of the reproductive number can only be inferred indirectly from the observed exponential epidemic growth rate r. Such inference is ambiguous as several different equations exist that relate the reproductive number to the growth rate, and it is unclear which of these equations might apply to a new infection. Here, we show that these different equations differ only with respect to their assumed shape of the generation interval distribution. Therefore, the shape of the generation interval distribution determines which equation is appropriate for inferring the reproductive number from the observed growth rate. We show that by assuming all generation intervals to be equal to the mean, we obtain an upper bound to the range of possible values that the reproductive number may attain for a given growth rate. Furthermore, we show that by taking the generation interval distribution equal to the observed distribution, it is possible to obtain an empirical estimate of the reproductive number.},

   Abstract = {Pneumonic plague poses a potentially increasing risk to humans in plague nonendemic regions either as a consequence of an aerosolized release or through importation of the disease. Pneumonic plague is person-to-person transmissible. We provide a quantitative assessment of transmissibility based on past outbreaks that shows that the average number of secondary cases per primary case (R-0) was 1.3 (variance = 3.1), assuming a geometric probability distribution, prior to outbreak control measures. We also show that the latent and infectious periods can be approximated by using lognormal distributions with means (SD) of 4.3 (1.8) and 2.5 (1.2) days. Based on this parameter estimation, we construct a Markov-chain epidemic model to demonstrate the potential impact of delays in implementing outbreak control measures and increasing numbers of index cases on the incidence of cases in simulated outbreaks.},

   Journal = {Bull. Math. Biol.},
   Volume = {68},
   Number = {3},
   Pages = {679-702},
   Abstract = {The well-known formula for the final size of an epidemic was published by Kermack and McKendrick in 1927. Their analysis was based on a simple susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model that assumes exponentially distributed infectious periods. More recent analyses have established that the standard final size formula is valid regardless of the distribution of infectious periods, but that it fails to be correct in the presence of certain kinds of heterogeneous mixing (e.g., if there is a core group, as for sexually transmitted diseases). We review previous work and establish more general conditions under which Kermack and McKendrick's formula is valid. We show that the final size formula is unchanged if there is a latent stage, any number of distinct infectious stages and/or a stage during which infectives are isolated (the durations of each stage can be drawn from any integrable distribution). We also consider the possibility that the transmission rates of infectious Individuals are arbitrarily distributed-allowing, in particular, for the existence of super-spreaders-and prove that this potential complexity has no impact on the final Size formula. Finally. we show that the final size formula is unchanged even for a General class of spatial contact structures. We conclude that whenever a new respiratory pathogen emerges, an estimate of the expected magnitude of the epidemic can be made as soon the basic reproduction number R-0 can be approximated, and this estimate is likely to be improved only by more accurate estimates of R-0 not by knowledge of any other epidemiological details.},

Reliable quantification of various transmission pathways in these models is paramount for optimal resource allocation and successful design of public health intervention programs. However, with limited epidemiological data available in the case of an emerging disease, simple phenomenological models based on a smaller number of parameters can play an important role in our quest to make forward projections of possible outbreak scenarios. In this paper, we employ the generalized Richards model for stable numerical estimation of the epidemic size (defined as the total number of infections throughout the epidemic) and its turning point using case incidence data of the early epidemic growth phase. The minimization is carried out by what we call the Reduced Iteratively Regularized Gauss–Newton (RIRGN) algorithm, a problem-oriented numerical scheme that takes full advantage of the specific structure of the non-linear operator at hand. The convergence analysis of the RIRGN method is suggested and numerical simulations are conducted with real case incidence data for the 2014–15 Ebola epidemic in West Africa. We show that the proposed RIRGN provides a stable algorithm for early estimation of turning points using simple phenomenological models with limited data.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Deterministic and stochastic methods relying on early case incidence data for forecasting epidemic outbreaks have received increasing attention during the last few years. In mathematical terms, epidemic forecasting is an ill-posed problem due to instability of parameter identification and limited available data. While previous studies have largely estimated the time-dependent transmission rate by assuming specific functional forms (e.g., exponential decay) that depend on a few parameters, here we introduce a novel approach for the reconstruction of nonparametric time-dependent transmission rates by projecting onto a finite subspace spanned by Legendre polynomials. This approach enables us to effectively forecast future incidence cases, the clear advantage over recovering the transmission rate at finitely many grid points within the interval where the data are currently available. In our approach, we compare three regularization algorithms: variational (Tikhonov’s) regularization, truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD), and modified TSVD in order to determine the stabilizing strategy that is most effective in terms of reliability of forecasting from limited data. We illustrate our methodology using simulated data as well as case incidence data for various epidemics including the 1918 influenza pandemic in San Francisco and the 2014–2015 Ebola epidemic in West Africa.},

	abstract = {Parameter estimation problems in ordinary and partial differential equations constitute a large class of models described by ill-posed operator equations. A considerable number of such problems come from epidemiology and infectious disease modeling, with Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) being a very important example. While it is not difficult to find a solution of an SEIJCR ODE constrained least squares problem, this problem is extremely unstable and a number of different parameter combinations produce essentially the same case curve. This is a serious obstacle in the study of the Ebola virus epidemics, since reliable approximations of system parameters are important for the proper assessment of existing control measures as well as for the forward projections aimed at testing a variety of contact tracing policies. In this paper, we attempt a stable estimation of system parameters with the use of iterative regularization along with a special algorithm for computing initial values. The numerical study is illustrated by data fitting and forward projections for the most recent EVD outbreak in Sierra Leone and Liberia.},
