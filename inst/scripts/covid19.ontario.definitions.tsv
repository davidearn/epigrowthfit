Variable Name	Definition	Additional Notes
Reported Date	Reporting date of Ontario COVID-19 daily summary.	Ontario currently publishes a COVID-19 summary each day.  This variable represents the calendar date that the daily COVID-19 summary was published, not the actual date where cases may have first occurred or were reported.  The daily summary is based on data reported to the Ministry of Health from various organizations across Ontario including public health units, laboratories, hospitals and long term care facilities.
Confirmed Negative	Patients tested negative based on testing performed at both Public Health Ontario (PHO) Laboratory and National Microbiology Lab (NML).	"Confirmed Negative" is a legacy variable. It was only reported at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and stopped being reported on March 30, 2020.
Presumptive Negative	Patients tested negative at Public Health Ontario (PHO) Laboratory, but not yet tested by National Microbiology Lab (NML).	"Presumptive Negative" is a legacy variable. It was only reported at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and stopped being reported on February 20, 2020.
Presumptive Positive	Patients tested positive at Public Health Ontario (PHO)  Laboratory, but not yet tested by National Microbiology Lab (NML).	"Presumptive Positive" is a legacy variable. It was only reported at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and stopped being reported on March 2, 2020.
Confirmed Positive	Number of active confirmed positive COVID-19 cases in Ontario as measured on "Reported Date".	The "Confirmed Positive" value is calculated by taking "Total Cases" and subtracting "Resolved" and "Deaths" values.  Prior to March 30, 2020, and reflected within the data, a patient was considered a confirmed positive if they tested positive and had not had two consecutive negative test results greater than 24 hours apart.  As a result, following March 30, 2020, a variance in the data can be observed.
Resolved	Cumulative number of resolved cases as measured on "Reported Date".	Cases that are 14 days past symptom onset (if available) or 14 days past the episode date are classified as resolved for non-fatal cases that are not currently listed as hospitalized. Cases are also classified as resolved if the case is reported as “recovered” in iPHIS.  Prior to March 30, 2020, and reflected within the data, a case was considered resolved and a patient was deemed no longer infectious based on two consecutive negative tests performed at Public Health Ontario (PHO) Laboratory at least 24 hours apart.
Deaths	Cumulative number of fatalities of people with COVID-19 as measured on "Reported Date".	Public Health Units (PHUs) may publicly report deaths prior to updating the data in the Integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS) or the Coronavirus Rapid Entry System (CORES). The data in iPHIS or CORES may therefore be underreported. Deaths among non-laboratory confirmed cases reported are not included.  In the event of a discrepancy between the number of deaths in iPHIS or CORES and deaths publicly reported by PHUs, data reported by PHUs should be considered the most up to date.
Total Cases	Cummulative number of confirmed cases reported to date in iPHIS by Ontario’s 32 Public Health Units (PHUs) by Toronto Public Health in the Coronavirus Rapid Entry System (CORES) and by Ottawa Public Health in The COVID-19 Ottawa Database (The COD) and Middlesex-London COVID-19 Case and Contact Management tool (CCMtool), including resolved and deceased cases..	PHUs may publicly report on cases prior to updating the data in iPHIS. In the event of a discrepancy between iPHIS cases and cases publicly reported by PHUs, data reported by PHUs should be considered the most up to date
Total patients approved for testing as of Reporting Date	Cumulative number of tests submitted to the COVID-19 Clinical Lab network (including PHO, hospital and community laboratories) as measured on "Reported Date".	As of April 15, 2020, this number represents total tests and not persons tested.  Between March 30, 2020 and April 15, 2020, this number represented the number of patients tested. Prior to March 30, 2020, this number represented the total number of patients approved for testing.
Total tests completed in the last day	Number of tests processed and completed during the day before the "Reported Date" (the 24-hour period from 12:00 a.m. – 11:59 p.m.).	
Under Investigation	Number of tests pending results as measured on "Reported Date".	
Number of patients hospitalized with COVID-19	Number of patients currently hospitalized with COVID-19 as measured on "Reported Date".	Data is self-reported by the hospitals to the Ministry of Health and may not match the numbers posted by local public health units. The values represent the total number of patients hospitalized regardless of where in the hospital they are located, including patients hospitalized within the ICU. The hospitals’ midnight census data are reported and are subject to periodic revision by the hospitals. 
Number of patients in ICU with COVID-19	Number of patients currently in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with COVID-19 as measured on "Reported Date".	Intensive Care Unit (ICU) data includes patients in levels 2 and 3 flex, neonatal, pediatric, and adult ICU beds. The reported numbers reflect the previous day’s values. As patients begin to be transferred between units (eg; from lower level of care to a higher level of care), it has become apparent that the previous methods of identifying patients based on a 24-hour time period would count patients transferred between different locations twice; once in each location they were at during the course of the day. In order to eliminate this issue, patients will no longer be counted over a 24 hour period, but will be counted at a single point in time (11:59 pm) to ensure that each person is only counted once.
Number of patients in ICU on a ventilator with COVID-19	Number of patients currently in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU), on a ventilator with COVID-19 as measured on "Reported_Date".	Intensive Care Unit (ICU) data includes patients in levels 2 and 3 flex, neonatal, pediatric, and adult ICU beds. The reported numbers reflect the previous day’s values. As patients begin to be transferred between units (eg; from lower level of care to a higher level of care), it has become apparent that the previous methods of identifying patients based on a 24-hour time period would count patients transferred between different locations twice; once in each location they were at during the course of the day. In order to eliminate this issue, patients will no longer be counted over a 24 hour period, but will be counted at a single point in time (11:59 pm) to ensure that each person is only counted once.
Total Positive LTC Resident Cases	Cumulative COVID-19 positive cases among residents of Long Term Care homes as measured on "Reported Date".

Excludes cases that reported ‘Yes’ to both risk factors: ‘Resident of nursing home or other chronic care facility’ and ‘health care worker’.  Deaths are determined by using the outcome field in iPHIS, CORES, CCMtool or The COD (see: https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/confirmed-positive-cases-of-covid-19-in-ontario). Deaths are determined by using the outcome field in iPHIS, CORES, CCMtool or The COD. Any case marked "Fatal" is included in the deaths data. Deaths are included whether or not COVID-19 was determined to be a contributing or underlying cause of death as indicated in the iPHIS field “Type of Death”.
